# Olympic Events App Proposal

Date: February 14th, 2022

## Motivation and Purpose

*Our role:* Data Scientist Team Hired By an Olympic Media Outlet

*Target audience:* Community members who are interested in the olympics

With the 2022 Beijing Olympics currently underway, community members are steeped in anticipation for what is to come. The huge diversity of sports available
to watch creates an overwhelming number of statistics that can be difficult for community members to comprehend. However, greater accessibility to Olympic data is necessary
to inform users' decisions about what sports to watch at the 2022 Beijing Olympics and future Olympic games. For example, a community member may want to know which sport their home country 
has historically performed better or worse at since this could influence their decision about what sports to tune in to in future Olympic games. Our data visualization app
aims to make Olympic data accessible and digestible for community members, and potentially inform individual watching behaviours at future Olympic games. Our 
app will show the distribution of factors contributing to gold medals in past Olympic games and will allow users to explore various aspects of this data with ease
by filtering and re-ordering on different variables, such as country, geographical location, and sport.
