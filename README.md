# Olympic Games Dashboard
An interactive dashboard demonstrating statistics regarding the Summer and Winter Olympic Games over the years.

## Description

This app will provide a dashboard that summarizes a few of the key statistics that we have extracted from this data. Specifically, our dashboard aims to provide
accessible visuals that demonstrate the differences in biological sex, geographic location, and physical characteristics of athletes and how these factors impact performance within the Olympic Games. Our dashboard will be segregated into 3 tabs: 'Gender Equality', 'Home Field Advantage', and 'Do Physical Attributes Affect Performance?'.

Within the 'Gender Equality' tab, we will provide a line chart in the top right panel to indicate the number of medals received by athletes, color-coded by biological sex. The bottom two panels that accompany the line chart will allow the user to interactively select which country they would like to filter for via a drop-down menu bar. Notably, each panel will interact with the drop-down menu that allows the user to select a country. Other information provided in this tab will demonstrate the number of total medals received and the total number of athletes within the filtered country and a specified year.

Within the 'Home Field Advantage' tab, we will allow users to interactively select a year via a drop-down menu bar to view which country hosted the Olympic Games for that specified year, which will be highlighted on a world map. Additionally, this drop-down menu will interact with the other panels to highlight the selected country in those panels. The panel on the right will compare the number of medals received by the selected 'home' country in other Olympic Games and compare this with the number of medals received when hosting the Olympic games. The bottom-left panel will highlight how the number of medals in the home country compares with the number of medals received by other teams for the selected year.

Finally, the 'Do Physical Attributes Affect Performance?
