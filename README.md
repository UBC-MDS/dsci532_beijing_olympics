## Motivation

*Overview*

2022 was another great year of sports at the Olympic Games in Beijing. It is quite incredible to see the countless hours of effort from thousands of athletes manifest at the Olympic Games. For viewers, it may be overwhelming to analyze the large number of statistics available for the Olympic Games over the years. 

This app aims to make Olympic Games data accessible and digestible for community members, and potentially inform their watching patterns in future Olympic games. Our app will show the distribution of factors contributing to received medals in past Olympic games and will allow users to explore various aspects of this data with ease by filtering and re-ordering on different variables, such as country, geographical location, and sport. In essence, we hope that individuals can use the data presented in this app to inform their decisions about which teams, countries, or sports to watch at the Olympics while allowing them to answer questions about the Olympic Games that would otherwise be difficult to answer.

*Description*

This app will provide a dashboard that summarizes a few of the key statistics that we have extracted from this data. Specifically, our dashboard aims to provide accessible visuals that demonstrate the differences in biological sex, geographic location, and the age of athletes and how these factors impact performance within the Olympic Games.

Our dashboard will contain a global map to give users easy access to the number of medals received by each country at the Olympic Games within a specified year. Speicific countries can then be selected on the map to filter the remaining plots on the dashboard by the country selected. This will allow the user to observe various statistics about the Olympics for their selected country. Moreover, they will be able to see how many medals were received by their selected country distributed by the age of the athletes. The users will also be able to see the number of bronze, silver, and gold medals received by both male and female individuals within their selected country. Furthermore, we will provide additional functionality to the user to allow them to filter these plots by sport and by year.
