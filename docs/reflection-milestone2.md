# Reflection

### 1. What we have implemented

We have implemented three plots from our milestone 1, which are:

1.  `Number of medals won by each country` world map
2.  `Number of Gold, Silver and Bronze medals across Gender` bar plot
3.  `Number of medals across Age` histogram

### 2. What we decided not to implement

From the milestone 1, we have not included the three separate tabs that we had initially planned because of the time constraints. However, we have tried to take the most informative features from each of them to cover the basic points that one might be interested in when looking for past Olympic Games information. We had initially planned on highlighting the host country of each specific year on the map. However, we decided against this because of the time constraints, since this would require an additional mapping of Host City to Country.

### 3. What we think our dashboard does well and what its limitations are

Our current dashboard has many of the basic functionalities that we planned to have from Milestone 1, including the capabilities of:

-   Interactive dropdown menu options for users to select and filter the analysis by Year, Country and Sex.

-   Tooltips within the map and age plot that allow users to interact with the plots and obtain precise information.

Unfortunately, we were not able to include additional important plots such as whether a country does better in their home town in comparison to their previous Olympic Game performances or the physical parameters that are most likely to be competitively better within a particular sport. Additionally, we feel that our interactivity between the plots is limited, and we look to improve this in the future, by allowing users the ability to click on the map to select and filter the other two plots by a country of interest. This is still in the works and will be implemented at a later time.

### 4. What are potential improvements and additions

If we had more time in the future, we have a couple of potential additions or editions in mind:

-   Make multiple tabs which relay specific information instead of having one tab with just basic information. For example, we can have a dedicated tab for sex-specific plots, one for physical attribute advantages, one which only analyses host country performance, and one to provide a specific event summary

-   We look to continually make cosmetic improvements in the plots such as font size, color schemes and titles, as well as the dashboard as a whole
