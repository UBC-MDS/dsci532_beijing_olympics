# Reflection

### 1. What we have implemented

We have implemented three plots from our milestone 1, which are:

1.  `Number of medals won by each country` world map
2.  `Number of Gold, Silver and Bronze medals across Gender` bar plot
3.  `Number of medals across Age` histogram

### 2. What we decided not to implement

From the milestone 1, we have not included the three separate tabs like we initially planned because of the time constraint which spoke to each section very well. But we have tried to take the best features from each of them to cover the basic points one might be interested in when looking for past Olympic information. We are not highlighting the host country of the particular year on the map since that would require an additional mapping of Host City to Country.

### 3. What we think our dashboard does well and what its limitations are

Our current dashboard has many of the basic functionalities that we planned to have from Milestone 1, including the capabilities of:

-   Interactive dropdown options for users to select Year and Country for all the plots

-   A tool tip which indicates the country and number of medals won by it

-   Selecting a particular country which further filters the other two plots to show the distribution across the selected country

The limitations are that we have not included important plots such as whether the host country does better in terms of medals than it did in the previous games or people with what physical parameters are most likely to win a particular sport.

### 4. What are potential improvements and additions

If we had more time in the future, we have a couple of potential additions or editions in mind:

-   Make multiple tabs which relay specific information instead of having one tab with just basic information. For example, we can have a dedicated tab for just Gender specific plots or one which only analyses host country performance or a specific event summary

-   Make cosmetic improvements in the plots such as font size, color schemes and titles
